"""
The functions can go of simple tasks to very extense processes in which 
we need order in the code that we are maintaining. Something important 
of the functions is the "Return", it returns the value that we are assigning 
it to save it into a variable or print the value on the console. It should 
be clarified that the order of the values will be the same order that will 
be saved in the variables.
