The Scope is the range of the variables or functions of a program, 
this is because sometimes we have two variables that have been 
initialized into a function, and we can't, this is because the 
variable it's in a local Scope, this means that it only exists in 
the range of the function, moreover, when we initialize a variable 
out of any function, we can use it in all the program.
