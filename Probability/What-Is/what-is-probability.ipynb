    "**Frequentist view:** This school is based on the **Elemental Success** by saying that every event has the same probability, but the problem with this way is that the total events are uncertain because when we make less events, the probability of every one will change, **If you throw a coin 10 times, it probably won't fall 3 times in face and 5 times in price**. This model serves when we are using a lot of events, because the more events we make, the more certain the result will be."
